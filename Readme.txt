# Local LLM × EEG Experiments Playground (Beta)

Run 70B models locally while streaming real EEG data – zero cloud, zero soldering.

→ Full guides + copy-paste labs  
https://neuraltechguide.com/labs/

### Coming soon (MIT licensed)
- Llama-3.1-70B + OpenBCI streaming in one terminal command
- Prompt templates for “thought-to-text” experiments
- Real-time attention/focus scoring notebooks
- Fully offline, private, driver-free setup

### Current status
Beta – migrating everything from the website.  
Your star today = one more feature tomorrow

### Love it? Keep it alive
Buy me a coffee → https://buymeacoffee.com/neuraltechguide  
(one coffee = one more weekend of pure open-source madness)

Made with ❤️ for privacy-focused neuro-AI tinkerers

Star if you want local-only brain-computer interfaces  
Share if offline 70B + EEG sounds insane (in the best way)
